# chatroom
Real-time chatroom site allowing users to register an account and login to chat with other users. Users have the ability to chat, change their names, passwords, and even add a profile picture.

Chatrooms are created by other users and contain tags to describe the topics. Others can search all chatrooms to find new chatrooms to join.

This site was created using the MERN stack as well as PusherJS to notify the frontend whenever a change in the database occurs to allow for a real-time update on the frontend.

Site deployed at: https://calm-taiga-20685.herokuapp.com/
